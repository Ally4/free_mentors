## From Challenge 1 - Create UI Templates

In a [feature branch](https://github.com/key-joshua/free_mentors/tree/feature), i have created a directory called UI which contains_out all the necessary pages specified in instructions and that UI elements will allow the application function into the UI directory.

#### The pages where a user (client) can do the following:

* Sign up page.
* Sign in page.
* View mentors page.
* View a specific mentor page.
* Create a mentorship session page.

#### A pages where an admin can do the following:

* Change a user to a mentor page.


#### The page where a mentor can do the following:

* Accept a mentorship session request page.
* Decline a mentorship session request page.


## Optional Features
Rather than from those instructions we have been asked as specified above we will need another optional features like those below:

* Users can view all their mentorship sessions.
* Users can review a mentor after a mentorship session.
* Admin can delete a review deemed as inappropriate.
